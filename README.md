# OpenVPN
OpenVPN installer for Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS and Fedora.

### Installation

The virtual machine (AWS EC2, Azure VM, Huawei ECS) need to just have a private IP with only one network interface. No need to use NAT Gateway. Consider your Routing Table rules.
Elastic IP will be the Public IP gateway of the VM.

`Internet  ---> Elastic IP ---> Private Interface of VM`

Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehmetihsansevinc/openvpn/refs/heads/main/openvpn-install.sh -O openvpn-install.sh  && bash openvpn-install.sh`

You can run it to add more users, remove some of them or uninstall WireGuard.
